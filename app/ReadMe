Still need to fix the update functionality.
Right now it updates if the last database fetch was more than 12 hours ago and then reloads allllll the data.
This takes a lot of time. Almost a full minute.

Option 1:
One way around it would be to only grab data until it finds an event that's in the database then break out....
This would involve changing the scrape code to check each event against the database....

option 2:
Another way would be to learn threading and have the data process in the background
This is probably the real way but will take a good bit of research

option 3:
And another way is instead of using the created column, I could have the website update at specific times (eg 4am every day) it wouldn't be automatically up to date but would rarely slow the page down for an actual user.

I'm leaning toward option 1 it makes the most sense to me and seems easy enough.
